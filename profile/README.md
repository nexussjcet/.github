# The Nexus, SJCET
The Nexus, SJCET was formed on 12 September, 2018 by a few free thinkers to support and organize Free/Libre and Open-Source Software and Hardware related activities in [SJCET](http://nexus.sjcetpalai.ac.in). 

We support:
- The freedoms of:
  -  Speech
  -  Press
  -  Association on the Internet
- The Right to:
  - [use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
  - study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.
  - write software and engineer hardware unimpeded by private monopolies 

# The Nexus Project
The Nexus Project was a sort of place dedicated for software and hardware freedom functioning from SJCET Palai. Created by Abraham Reji in November 11, 2018. 

In 2022 the Nexus was restructured by Rajat Mathew as the FOSS Club of SJCET, combining 3 generations of open source software clubs under one umbrella.

Clubs
- Swathanthra Group, inaugurated by Richard M Stallman in 2010
- ICFOSS Cell, joined in 2018
- Mozilla Campus Club of SJCET, created at 2013
